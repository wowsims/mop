description: "Work on the React migration of the wowsims MoP frontend (ui/). Use this whenever you are writing, porting or reviewing a UI component, adding a shared primitive, touching JSX or the tsx-vanilla/React boundary, moving SCSS next to a component, or wondering why part of ui/ is React and part is not. Also use it before building any new widget, because the component registry below likely already has one. Self-documenting: update the registry and the Change log in the same commit as any shared-component change."

# wowsims-react

The view layer of `ui/`, mid-migration from `tsx-vanilla` to React.

For everything below the view layer — the layer map, the Zustand store contract, the
state-vs-events rule, persistence, the QA recipes — read `wowsims-ui`. This skill does not
restate them; it assumes them.

## Where the migration currently is

**Phase 1 is complete.** React owns the page root and the top-level tab behaviour; every tab body
is still a vanilla `Component`, and nothing in `features/` has been ported.

Branch `feature/ui-react`, worktree `~/personal/wowsims-mop-react`, stacked on
`feature/ui-restructure`.

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 — JSX coexistence, React 19, store hooks, LegacyHost, vitest, hook lint rules | **done** |
| 1 — React root, React-owned top-level tabs (same DOM) | **done** |
| 2 — ui-kit primitives land *beside* the vanilla ones | next |
| 3 — features port inward, easiest first | not started |
| 4 — island wrappers (combat replay, Chart.js, VirtualList) | not started |
| 5 — delete tsx-vanilla, the shim, the vanilla Component/Input stack, Bootstrap JS, tippy | not started |

Full plan, including the duplication inventory that drives Phase 2:
`~/.claude/plans/based-on-feature-ui-restructure-start-vast-yeti.md`.

### What React owns today

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `ui/app/spec_entry.tsx` | `createRoot(#root).render(<StrictMode><SimApp/></StrictMode>)` — the only `react-dom/client` import |
| `ui/app/sim_app.tsx` | Constructs `IndividualSimUI` exactly once into a ref'd `<div>`, then renders `<SimTabs>` |
| `ui/app/sim_tabs.tsx` | Order, click handling and `active`/`show` for the top-level tabs. Renders `null` |
| `ui/ui-kit/tab_registry.ts` | `SimTabRegistry` — the tab set and which one is open, as a `useSyncExternalStore` source |

The plan called for a DOM-free `IndividualSimHost` constructed before `createRoot`. That is not
possible as written: `SimHost` requires `rootElem`, `resultsViewer`, `simTabContentsContainer` and
`addAction()`, and the `features:` behaviour slots add sidebar buttons during construction. The
construct-once problem it was meant to solve is solved instead by a `useRef` gate in `SimApp`,
which is what makes StrictMode's double-invoked effect safe. A test asserts the gate (it fails
without it).

## The JSX boundary — the thing that surprises people

Both JSX dialects compile in this tree. Which one a file gets is decided per file:

- **React is the default.** `tsconfig.json` is `jsx: react-jsx` / `jsxImportSource: react`, and both
  vite configs use the automatic runtime. A new `.tsx` file with no pragma is a React file.
- **A file opts out** with `/** @jsxImportSource @jsx-vanilla */` on line 1. All 94 pre-existing
  `.tsx` files carry it. Their JSX still returns real DOM nodes.

The shim is `ui/shared/jsx-vanilla/jsx-runtime.ts` and it is a direct call through to
tsx-vanilla's `element`, because `element` already accepts children inside `props`: intrinsic tags
prefer `props.children` over the varargs, `children` is in the library's `specialProps` so it is
never assigned to the DOM node, and function components receive `props` unchanged. Its behaviour is
pinned by `jsx-runtime.test.tsx` — if you change the shim, that suite is what tells you whether you
broke `{cond && <x/>}`, `{0}`, or fragments.

Why the types do not collide: tsx-vanilla declares a **global** `JSX` namespace and `@types/react`
19 does not (React's lives in `React.JSX`, re-exported from `react/jsx-runtime`). React files
resolve the module-scoped namespace; opted-out files fall back to the global one. This is why the
migration needs React 19 specifically — React 18's types would collide.

When you port a file to React, **delete its pragma**. That is the whole switch.

## The dual-stack rule

Phase 2 is additive. React components land as new folders; the vanilla `Input` base class and the
12 existing pickers are **not modified and not deleted** until Phase 5.

The reason is mechanical: a still-vanilla view calls `new NumberPicker(parent, config)`. If the
vanilla class were converted in place, every un-ported caller would need a bridge that mounts React
*into* a vanilla parent — a `createRoot` per widget, which is the architecture this migration
rejected. So both stacks coexist, and a component is adopted by a feature only when that feature
ports.

If you find yourself editing a vanilla picker to make a React one work, stop — you are about to
break every caller that has not moved yet.

## Frozen for the whole migration

`ui/sims/**` (all 34 spec definitions) and the `defineSpec` schema in `ui/features/spec_config.ts`
— `IndividualSimUIConfig`, `InputConfig`, `IconInputConfig`, `CustomSection`, `SpecBehaviors` — are
the contract React renders against. A spec-file diff in a migration PR is a reject, not a nit. This
is the surface a mechanical port is most likely to "improve" in passing.

## Component registry

Every shared component lives here. **Check this table before building a widget** — the whole point
of the duplication sweep was to build each shape once.

| Component | Path | Replaces | Parameterises | Fixes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NumberPicker` | `ui/ui-kit/NumberPicker/` | `ui-kit/pickers/number_picker.ts` (still live, dual-stack) | the `NumberPickerConfig` it is given | commit on native `change`, the `size` rule, and the float/positive/showZeroes formats |
| `EnumPicker` | `ui/ui-kit/EnumPicker/` | `ui-kit/pickers/enum_picker.tsx` (still live, dual-stack) | the `EnumPickerConfig` it is given | the `select`/`option` markup and out-of-range selection |
| `PickerShell` | `ui/ui-kit/react/picker_shell.tsx` | `Input`'s constructor: root classes, label, description | the picker's own class and its input(s) | class order, `form-label`, tooltip and description handling |
| `BooleanPicker` | `ui/ui-kit/BooleanPicker/` | `ui-kit/pickers/boolean_picker.ts` (still live, dual-stack) | the `BooleanPickerConfig` it is given | the `input-root`/`form-check` markup and where the input sits |
| `useInput` | `ui/ui-kit/react/input.ts` | `Input`'s init/refresh/update cycle | a `ModObject` + an `InputConfig` | reading, writing, `showWhen`, `enableWhen`, `defaultValue` |
| `Button` | `ui/ui-kit/Button/` | 132 clickables — 91 `<button>`, 41 `<a>` — across 12 areas | the element (`as`), `variant`, `size`, any native props | the `btn` base class, `type="button"`, and that `as="a"` carries an `href` |
| `Tooltip` | `ui/ui-kit/Tooltip/` | `tippy()`, 61 call sites / 33 files | `content` (any node), `place`, `clickable`, the anchor (`data-tooltip-id`) | the theme, and that unmount removes it |
| `Icon` | `ui/ui-kit/Icon/` | hand-written `<i className="fas fa-…">`, 64 sites / 37 files / 11 features | `name` (closed union incl. FA5 aliases), `style`, `size`, `spin` | glyph identity, size validity, style spelling |
| `LegacyHost` | `ui/ui-kit/react/LegacyHost.tsx` | — (bridge) | `create`, `deps` | mounting an un-ported `Component` inside React |
| `useStoreSubscribe` | `ui/ui-kit/react/store.ts` | — (binding) | a `StoreSubscribe` + a read | binding existing subscriptions to a component |

Not yet built, in rough priority — see the plan for evidence and counts:
`ActionIcon`
(the `ActionId` dom writers), `FieldRow`, `PickerGroup`, `IconButton`; then the feature-shaped ones,
of which `SummaryTableRow` + `SummaryResetButton` is the cheapest and `ItemCell` the largest.

### Adding a component to the registry

Add its row **in the same commit** as the component, plus a Change log entry. A component with no
row is how the next person builds it a second time — that is the failure this table exists to
prevent, so treat a missing row as a failed review rather than a formatting nit.

## Why abstractions here get bypassed — read this before designing one

Six existing abstractions in this tree are ignored by most of their potential callers. There are
exactly two causes, and both are avoidable.

**It fixes the axis that actually varies.** `ItemRenderer` fixes layout while its callers vary icon
tag, name row, sockets and ilvl — 7 of 9 hand-roll instead. `SimTab.buildColumn` does N equal
columns while 7 callers want a left/right pair. `fillAndSetActionId` assumes one anchor with a
background image, while callers have two elements, an `<img>`, or an `AbortSignal` — it is used
once out of ~9 sites. `TooltipButton` hardcodes its icon and classes, so three call sites that need
`d-inline` rewrote it.

**It exists but cannot be reached.** `Input.buildLabel` is private and every bypasser extends
`Component`, not `Input`. `TalentTreePicker` is module-scoped and unexported, so `pet_spec_picker`
retyped its markup *and its class names*.

So when you add a shared component, say in its header comment which axis it parameterises and which
it fixes, and export it from the feature's `index.ts`. If a caller cannot express what it needs
through props, widen the props — do not let it fork the markup, because a fork also forks the CSS
class names, and then the stylesheet has two owners.

## Pickers: how a React component consumes `InputConfig`

`InputConfig` is part of the frozen spec surface, so React fits itself to it, not the other way
round. `useInput(modObject, config)` is that fit, and every React picker is built on it. It returns
`{ value, setValue, hidden, disabled }`, and three of its rules are not obvious:

- **`getValue` is re-read only when the source notifies**, and the result is held in between — this
  lives in `useStoreSubscribe`, so it protects every binding, not just pickers. It is required, not
  an optimisation: configs such as the encounter target list return `getTargets().slice()` — a new
  array on every call — and `useSyncExternalStore` treats a new snapshot identity as a change, which
  React reports as *"The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop"*. The
  vanilla `Input` has the same behaviour: it re-reads in `refresh()`, on notification.
- **`description` and `labelTooltip` are `string | Element`, and the Element form is real**
  (`reforge_panel.tsx:527`). Render it with `adoptNode` from `ui-kit/react/dom.ts`; casting it to
  string produces `[object HTMLDivElement]` and nothing fails.
- **`showWhen` renders the `hide` class rather than unmounting.** The plan calls conditional
  rendering the idiom React deletes, and that holds for the hand-rolled container toggles — but a
  picker's own node has to stay while Phase 3 compares DOM against the vanilla build. Revisit in
  Phase 5, when there is no vanilla side to compare against.
- **`defaultValue` seeds the input and the source takes over at the first notification**, whether or
  not the value actually changed — `init()` then `refresh()` in the vanilla class. Vanilla tests it
  for *truthiness*, so a `defaultValue` of 0 is ignored; matched rather than corrected.
- **`revision` counts notifications**, and a picker holding text the user is editing re-syncs on it
  rather than on a value change. `Input.refresh()` runs on every notification, so half-typed input is
  reset by any store event, not only by one that changes this input's value.
- **A text or select picker is uncontrolled and synced imperatively.** Not the usual React shape, and
  deliberate: the vanilla picker commits on the native `change` event — blur *after an edit*, and
  Enter — while React's `onChange` is the input event, which fires per keystroke. Committing on blur
  instead writes on a plain focus/blur, which with `defaultValue` or `positive` set writes a value the
  user never entered. A controlled `value` also renders a `value` attribute the vanilla DOM lacks and
  ties `size` to every render instead of to typing. `BooleanPicker` stays controlled: a checkbox's
  `change` and React's `onChange` are the same event.

## Co-located SCSS, in practice

A component's stylesheet sits beside its TSX and is imported from it. Vite merges it into the same
stylesheet the `<link>` tags in `index_template.html` already produce, and `spec_pages.mts` copies
that page to all 34 spec URLs — nothing has to be registered anywhere.

- `@import 'shared/tokens';` is how a component reaches variables and mixins. It resolves through
  `css.preprocessorOptions.scss.loadPaths`, so the path is the same at any depth.
- `shared/variables` **cannot** be imported alone: it extends bootstrap's `$theme-colors` and uses
  bootstrap mixins, so `shared/_tokens.scss` loads bootstrap's functions, variables and mixins first.
  That costs about 30 ms of Sass per component stylesheet (measured: ten of them add 0.27 s to a
  1.8 s build), which is why one stylesheet per component is the unit, not one per file.
- A vendor stylesheet is imported from the TSX **before** the component's own, because in the
  emitted bundle import order is cascade order and most vendor rules are single-class.

## Component folder layout

```
ui/ui-kit/<Name>/{ <Name>.tsx, <Name>.scss, types.ts, index.ts }
ui/features/<feature>/components/<Name>/{ … }      # `view/` is renamed as each feature ports
ui/features/<feature>/model/                        # unchanged, DOM-free, lint-enforced
```

`types.ts` only when the prop surface earns its own file. `index.ts` is the public surface — a
component nobody can import is a component that gets rebuilt.

Use `tools/restructure/move.mjs` for moves; it repairs every import specifier across `ui/` and
`tools/`. `--dry-run` first.

## SCSS: co-located, still BEM, and a merge rather than a move

Styles move next to their component, but keep BEM — **not** CSS Modules. Scoping would break four
things this tree relies on: `@extend` of Bootstrap utilities and of `.tab-pane-content-container`
(shared by five tab files), tooltips and popups that portal to `<body>`, the `$sim-themes` body
class that themes all 34 specs, and the global utilities (`.hide`, `.icon-md`, `.p-gap`) used in
30+ files.

Two hazards when you move a component's styles:

**It is a merge, not a move.** Rules for one component are already split across files —
`.dropdown-menu` across 9, `.input-root` across 6, `.content-block-header` and `-body` across 5
each. Source order currently decides which wins, so gather them deliberately and check the result
rather than concatenating.

**Some class names have squatters.** `bulk_item_search` and `gear_change_icon` reuse
`item-picker-ilvl` / `item-picker-sockets-container` while building their own markup, and
`pet_spec_picker` reuses the entire `talent-tree-*` / `talent-picker-*` vocabulary to piggyback on
the talent tree's stylesheet. Co-locating those styles silently breaks the piggybacker. Grep the
class name across `ui/` before moving its rules.

## Things that will bite

- **StrictMode is a no-op in every build this app produces.** `vite build` — and
  `vite build --mode development`, and `NODE_ENV=development vite build` — all embed React's
  production bundle. Effects are double-invoked only under the dev server (`node_modules/.bin/vite`)
  and vitest, so that is where a construct-once or double-subscribe bug can be caught at all.
  Verified by removing `SimApp`'s gate: the dev server then renders two shells, a built page one.
- **Dropping a `data-bs-*` attribute drops behaviour you cannot see.** Bootstrap's tab plugin, on
  `window load`, gave every `.active[data-bs-toggle="tab"]` a roving `tabindex`, `role="tabpanel"`
  on its pane and arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation. Removing the attribute removed all of it
  silently: class-level DOM parity was green, the click sweep was green, and keyboard users had lost
  tab navigation. Before replacing any Bootstrap widget, read its `js/dist/*.js` for what its
  constructor stamps on the DOM, and diff *attributes and keyboard behaviour* against the parent
  branch — `tools/react-migration/tabs-a11y.mjs` is the pattern.
- **react-tooltip renders in place, not in a portal.** The tooltip element is a child of wherever
  the `<Tooltip>` sits in the React tree, so an anchor inside an `overflow: hidden` container needs
  `positionStrategy="fixed"` or a tooltip declared higher up. The plan assumed a body portal.
- **react-tooltip injects its stylesheet at runtime unless told not to.** `disableStyleInjection`
  alone only stops the *base* styles; `disableStyleInjection="core"` stops both, which is what the
  `Tooltip` component passes. The library's `REACT_TOOLTIP_DISABLE_*_STYLES` env vars are useless in
  a browser bundle — the guard around them tests `typeof process`, which is `undefined` there. An
  injected `<style>` lands in `<head>` after the bundle, so it silently outranks a component theme.
- **Sim progress bypasses the store.** The worker progress callback writes DOM directly, per tick,
  unbatched. Route it into a slice or hold it behind a ref and throttle — never `setState` per tick.
- **Goldens do not cover the shell.** `tools/state-snapshots/snapshot.ts` imports
  `IndividualSimUIConfig` as a *type* and hand-mirrors `applyDefaults`. They prove no state write
  leaked into a component. They say nothing about whether anything rendered.
- **`ListPicker` splices the array you give it.** `getValue` returns a `.slice()`.
- **Some tab contents read the live document while being constructed.** `detailed_results.tsx`
  does `document.querySelector('.dr-toolbar')` (and the same for the sticky-toolbar root) inside its
  constructor, so its pane must already be in the page by then. This is why `SimTabRegistry.attach`
  appends both elements itself instead of leaving placement to React — React only reasserts order
  afterwards. Any React-rendered pane in Phase 2+ hits this: fix the lookups before moving the pane
  into a component's render, or they silently find nothing.
- **Tooltips portal to `<body>`**, so they outlive their component's subtree. Unmount cleanup is
  load-bearing; assert it in the component's test.
- **`localization.tsx` walks the DOM** for `[data-i18n]` and writes `textContent`. React
  reconciliation clobbers that — React components need `useTranslation`. Checked in Phase 1: the
  only page that depends on the walk is the landing page (`ui/index.html` + `ui/index.ts`, 132 nodes
  at runtime). `ui/index_template.html` carries only `data-i18n-lang` on `<html>`, which sets the
  lang attribute and touches no text. So the walk constrains the homepage only — and the homepage is
  the page React does not obviously improve.
- **`use` is a reserved prefix now.** `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` keys on it, so a non-hook helper
  named `useX` is a lint error. Name factories `makeUseX` (this is why
  `makeUseDotBaseValueCheckbox` reads the way it does — the proto field is `useDotBaseValue`).
- **`rules-of-hooks` is not in the react plugin's default category.** It is listed explicitly in
  `.oxlintrc.json`; if you rebuild that config, it silently stops running.

## Verification

Run `wowsims-ui`'s gate list, plus `npm run test:unit` (vitest + happy-dom, config in
`vitest.config.mts`).

Two things specific to this migration:

- **Goldens must stay byte-identical.** The port touches `view/` only, so any golden diff means a
  state write leaked into a component. Never regenerate to make it pass.
- **DOM parity is the real gate for the shell**, and it lives in `tools/react-migration/` — four
  Playwright checks against a build of this branch and one of the parent branch, served on two
  ports. `parity.mjs` (structure at load, ~4,000 elements per spec), `panes-parity.mjs` (each tab's contents
  once opened), `tabs-a11y.mjs` (attributes + keyboard), `tabs-behaviour.mjs` (clicking every tab),
  `mount-once.mjs` (StrictMode — against a dev server, see above) and `landing.mjs` (the homepage,
  which every other check skips). Read its README for the
  two expected class diffs and the environmental console errors. Use Playwright, not the Chrome
  extension — the extension reports false "renderer frozen" on this app.

## Change log (keep current — this skill documents itself)

- 2026-09-05 Phase 2 opened. Groundwork first: `@base-ui/react` 1.7.0 and `react-tooltip` 6.0.8
  installed and proved to bundle under Vite 8's oxc, and the co-located SCSS pipeline proved end to
  end in dev and in the build (see the section above; `shared/_tokens.scss` is new). First component
  is `Tooltip` — react-tooltip with the app's tooltip theme, replacing tippy for React call sites as
  each feature ports — followed by `Button`, whose `as="a"` requires an `href` at the type level and
  whose `<button>` defaults to `type="button"`, both defects the hand-written markup allows. Then
  `useInput` and `BooleanPicker`: the first three features Phase 3 ports (character-stats, encounter,
  item-swap) are almost entirely pickers, so the `InputConfig` binding is the real critical path, and
  it is described in its own section above. Base UI is not involved in a checkbox — no Bootstrap JS
  drives one — so `BooleanPicker` emits the same markup as the vanilla picker and needs no new SCSS. Two things the library does that the plan did not predict are recorded under
  "Things that will bite". `vitest.setup.ts` now runs Testing Library's `cleanup` after each test,
  without which a second render finds the first one's DOM.

- 2026-09-05 Phase 1 complete: React renders the shell, in two steps. **1a** added
  `<div id="root">`, renamed `spec_entry.ts` → `.tsx`, and moved construction into `SimApp` behind a
  `useRef` gate — the shell is still built by `IndividualSimUI`, React just owns when. **1b**
  inverted the tabs: `SimTab` and `SimUI.addTab` hand their elements to `SimTabRegistry` instead of
  appending into the header and calling `data-bs-toggle="tab"`, and `SimTabs` decides order, clicks
  and `active`/`show`. Bootstrap's tab plugin no longer drives the top-level tabs; the tab sets
  *inside* detailed-results, bulk, rotation and the selector modal are still Bootstrap's, by design.
  `SimTabs` also re-implements what the plugin did beyond clicking — roving `tabindex`, arrow and
  Home/End navigation with wrap-around and focus following the selection — and panes carry
  `role="tabpanel"` in their markup, which the plugin used to stamp on load. Two behaviour notes:
  `SimHeader.activateTab` now calls `registry.activate` instead of `.click()`ing the nav-link, so a
  programmatic tab switch no longer fires `trackPageView` (user clicks still do); and the pane open
  on load gets `show` in the same frame as `active`, because only a *switch* needs to fade.
  `SimHeader.activateTab` now delegates to the registry, so the bulk results renderer's
  "back to gear" path is unchanged. Two deliberate DOM diffs against the parent branch, both
  pre-existing quirks removed rather than introduced: the gear nav-*link* no longer carries `show`
  (a pane class Bootstrap put there), and the literal class `false` from
  `${isFirstTab && 'active'}` is gone. Gate: DOM parity across 5 specs (element counts identical,
  only those two class diffs), a Playwright click sweep of all 6 tabs on those specs, goldens
  byte-identical, and 39 unit tests. The six checks are committed at `tools/react-migration/`.

- 2026-09-04 Phase 0 complete. React 19.2 alongside tsx-vanilla: tsconfig and both vite configs
  moved to the automatic runtime, the 94 existing `.tsx` files gained
  `/** @jsxImportSource @jsx-vanilla */`, and the shim landed at `ui/shared/jsx-vanilla/`. Both
  unknowns were verified rather than assumed — TypeScript 7 honours the per-file pragma, and Vite
  8's oxc transform does too (confirmed by inspecting the emitted bundle: React absent,
  tsx-vanilla's `element` present). DOM parity held across 5 specs. Added vitest + happy-dom
  (`npm run test:unit`), `LegacyHost`, `useStoreSubscribe`, and the typed `Icon`. Turned on
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` (error) and `exhaustive-deps` (warn), which forced renaming two
  non-hook APL builders to `makeUse*`. Measured, resolving an open question: a `batch()` writing
  three slices produces exactly one React render with or without `subscribeGated`, so the gate is a
  vanilla-subscriber concern only.
