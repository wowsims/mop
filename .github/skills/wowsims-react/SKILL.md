description: "Work on the React migration of the wowsims MoP frontend (ui/). Use this whenever you are writing, porting or reviewing a UI component, adding a shared primitive, touching JSX or the tsx-vanilla/React boundary, moving SCSS next to a component, or wondering why part of ui/ is React and part is not. Also use it before building any new widget, because the component registry below likely already has one. Self-documenting: update the registry and the Change log in the same commit as any shared-component change."

# wowsims-react

The view layer of `ui/`, mid-migration from `tsx-vanilla` to React.

For everything below the view layer — the layer map, the Zustand store contract, the
state-vs-events rule, persistence, the QA recipes — read `wowsims-ui`. This skill does not
restate them; it assumes them.

## Where the migration currently is

**Phase 1 is complete.** React owns the page root and the top-level tab behaviour; every tab body
is still a vanilla `Component`, and nothing in `features/` has been ported.

Branch `feature/ui-react`, worktree `~/personal/wowsims-mop-react`, stacked on
`feature/ui-restructure`.

| Phase | State |
|---|---|
| 0 — JSX coexistence, React 19, store hooks, LegacyHost, vitest, hook lint rules | **done** |
| 1 — React root, React-owned top-level tabs (same DOM) | **done** |
| 2 — ui-kit primitives land *beside* the vanilla ones | next |
| 3 — features port inward, easiest first | not started |
| 4 — island wrappers (combat replay, Chart.js, VirtualList) | not started |
| 5 — delete tsx-vanilla, the shim, the vanilla Component/Input stack, Bootstrap JS, tippy | not started |

Full plan, including the duplication inventory that drives Phase 2:
`~/.claude/plans/based-on-feature-ui-restructure-start-vast-yeti.md`.

### What React owns today

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `ui/app/spec_entry.tsx` | `createRoot(#root).render(<StrictMode><SimApp/></StrictMode>)` — the only `react-dom/client` import |
| `ui/app/sim_app.tsx` | Constructs `IndividualSimUI` exactly once into a ref'd `<div>`, then renders `<SimTabs>` |
| `ui/app/sim_tabs.tsx` | Order, click handling and `active`/`show` for the top-level tabs. Renders `null` |
| `ui/ui-kit/tab_registry.ts` | `SimTabRegistry` — the tab set and which one is open, as a `useSyncExternalStore` source |

The plan called for a DOM-free `IndividualSimHost` constructed before `createRoot`. That is not
possible as written: `SimHost` requires `rootElem`, `resultsViewer`, `simTabContentsContainer` and
`addAction()`, and the `features:` behaviour slots add sidebar buttons during construction. The
construct-once problem it was meant to solve is solved instead by a `useRef` gate in `SimApp`,
which is what makes StrictMode's double-invoked effect safe. A test asserts the gate (it fails
without it).

## The JSX boundary — the thing that surprises people

Both JSX dialects compile in this tree. Which one a file gets is decided per file:

- **React is the default.** `tsconfig.json` is `jsx: react-jsx` / `jsxImportSource: react`, and both
  vite configs use the automatic runtime. A new `.tsx` file with no pragma is a React file.
- **A file opts out** with `/** @jsxImportSource @jsx-vanilla */` on line 1. All 94 pre-existing
  `.tsx` files carry it. Their JSX still returns real DOM nodes.

The shim is `ui/shared/jsx-vanilla/jsx-runtime.ts` and it is a direct call through to
tsx-vanilla's `element`, because `element` already accepts children inside `props`: intrinsic tags
prefer `props.children` over the varargs, `children` is in the library's `specialProps` so it is
never assigned to the DOM node, and function components receive `props` unchanged. Its behaviour is
pinned by `jsx-runtime.test.tsx` — if you change the shim, that suite is what tells you whether you
broke `{cond && <x/>}`, `{0}`, or fragments.

Why the types do not collide: tsx-vanilla declares a **global** `JSX` namespace and `@types/react`
19 does not (React's lives in `React.JSX`, re-exported from `react/jsx-runtime`). React files
resolve the module-scoped namespace; opted-out files fall back to the global one. This is why the
migration needs React 19 specifically — React 18's types would collide.

When you port a file to React, **delete its pragma**. That is the whole switch.

## The dual-stack rule

Phase 2 is additive. React components land as new folders; the vanilla `Input` base class and the
12 existing pickers are **not modified and not deleted** until Phase 5.

The reason is mechanical: a still-vanilla view calls `new NumberPicker(parent, config)`. If the
vanilla class were converted in place, every un-ported caller would need a bridge that mounts React
*into* a vanilla parent — a `createRoot` per widget, which is the architecture this migration
rejected. So both stacks coexist, and a component is adopted by a feature only when that feature
ports.

If you find yourself editing a vanilla picker to make a React one work, stop — you are about to
break every caller that has not moved yet.

## Frozen for the whole migration

`ui/sims/**` (all 34 spec definitions) and the `defineSpec` schema in `ui/features/spec_config.ts`
— `IndividualSimUIConfig`, `InputConfig`, `IconInputConfig`, `CustomSection`, `SpecBehaviors` — are
the contract React renders against. A spec-file diff in a migration PR is a reject, not a nit. This
is the surface a mechanical port is most likely to "improve" in passing.

## Component registry

Every shared component lives here. **Check this table before building a widget** — the whole point
of the duplication sweep was to build each shape once.

| Component | Path | Replaces | Parameterises | Fixes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Icon` | `ui/ui-kit/Icon/` | hand-written `<i className="fas fa-…">`, 64 sites / 37 files / 11 features | `name` (closed union incl. FA5 aliases), `style`, `size`, `spin` | glyph identity, size validity, style spelling |
| `LegacyHost` | `ui/ui-kit/react/LegacyHost.tsx` | — (bridge) | `create`, `deps` | mounting an un-ported `Component` inside React |
| `useStoreSubscribe` | `ui/ui-kit/react/store.ts` | — (binding) | a `StoreSubscribe` + a read | binding existing subscriptions to a component |

Not yet built, in rough priority — see the plan for evidence and counts:
`Button` (polymorphic `as`, 132 clickables), `Tooltip` (react-tooltip, 33 files), `ActionIcon`
(the `ActionId` dom writers), `FieldRow`, `PickerGroup`, `IconButton`; then the feature-shaped ones,
of which `SummaryTableRow` + `SummaryResetButton` is the cheapest and `ItemCell` the largest.

### Adding a component to the registry

Add its row **in the same commit** as the component, plus a Change log entry. A component with no
row is how the next person builds it a second time — that is the failure this table exists to
prevent, so treat a missing row as a failed review rather than a formatting nit.

## Why abstractions here get bypassed — read this before designing one

Six existing abstractions in this tree are ignored by most of their potential callers. There are
exactly two causes, and both are avoidable.

**It fixes the axis that actually varies.** `ItemRenderer` fixes layout while its callers vary icon
tag, name row, sockets and ilvl — 7 of 9 hand-roll instead. `SimTab.buildColumn` does N equal
columns while 7 callers want a left/right pair. `fillAndSetActionId` assumes one anchor with a
background image, while callers have two elements, an `<img>`, or an `AbortSignal` — it is used
once out of ~9 sites. `TooltipButton` hardcodes its icon and classes, so three call sites that need
`d-inline` rewrote it.

**It exists but cannot be reached.** `Input.buildLabel` is private and every bypasser extends
`Component`, not `Input`. `TalentTreePicker` is module-scoped and unexported, so `pet_spec_picker`
retyped its markup *and its class names*.

So when you add a shared component, say in its header comment which axis it parameterises and which
it fixes, and export it from the feature's `index.ts`. If a caller cannot express what it needs
through props, widen the props — do not let it fork the markup, because a fork also forks the CSS
class names, and then the stylesheet has two owners.

## Component folder layout

```
ui/ui-kit/<Name>/{ <Name>.tsx, <Name>.scss, types.ts, index.ts }
ui/features/<feature>/components/<Name>/{ … }      # `view/` is renamed as each feature ports
ui/features/<feature>/model/                        # unchanged, DOM-free, lint-enforced
```

`types.ts` only when the prop surface earns its own file. `index.ts` is the public surface — a
component nobody can import is a component that gets rebuilt.

Use `tools/restructure/move.mjs` for moves; it repairs every import specifier across `ui/` and
`tools/`. `--dry-run` first.

## SCSS: co-located, still BEM, and a merge rather than a move

Styles move next to their component, but keep BEM — **not** CSS Modules. Scoping would break four
things this tree relies on: `@extend` of Bootstrap utilities and of `.tab-pane-content-container`
(shared by five tab files), tooltips and popups that portal to `<body>`, the `$sim-themes` body
class that themes all 34 specs, and the global utilities (`.hide`, `.icon-md`, `.p-gap`) used in
30+ files.

Two hazards when you move a component's styles:

**It is a merge, not a move.** Rules for one component are already split across files —
`.dropdown-menu` across 9, `.input-root` across 6, `.content-block-header` and `-body` across 5
each. Source order currently decides which wins, so gather them deliberately and check the result
rather than concatenating.

**Some class names have squatters.** `bulk_item_search` and `gear_change_icon` reuse
`item-picker-ilvl` / `item-picker-sockets-container` while building their own markup, and
`pet_spec_picker` reuses the entire `talent-tree-*` / `talent-picker-*` vocabulary to piggyback on
the talent tree's stylesheet. Co-locating those styles silently breaks the piggybacker. Grep the
class name across `ui/` before moving its rules.

## Things that will bite

- **StrictMode is a no-op in every build this app produces.** `vite build` — and
  `vite build --mode development`, and `NODE_ENV=development vite build` — all embed React's
  production bundle. Effects are double-invoked only under the dev server (`node_modules/.bin/vite`)
  and vitest, so that is where a construct-once or double-subscribe bug can be caught at all.
  Verified by removing `SimApp`'s gate: the dev server then renders two shells, a built page one.
- **Dropping a `data-bs-*` attribute drops behaviour you cannot see.** Bootstrap's tab plugin, on
  `window load`, gave every `.active[data-bs-toggle="tab"]` a roving `tabindex`, `role="tabpanel"`
  on its pane and arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation. Removing the attribute removed all of it
  silently: class-level DOM parity was green, the click sweep was green, and keyboard users had lost
  tab navigation. Before replacing any Bootstrap widget, read its `js/dist/*.js` for what its
  constructor stamps on the DOM, and diff *attributes and keyboard behaviour* against the parent
  branch — `tools/react-migration/tabs-a11y.mjs` is the pattern.
- **Sim progress bypasses the store.** The worker progress callback writes DOM directly, per tick,
  unbatched. Route it into a slice or hold it behind a ref and throttle — never `setState` per tick.
- **Goldens do not cover the shell.** `tools/state-snapshots/snapshot.ts` imports
  `IndividualSimUIConfig` as a *type* and hand-mirrors `applyDefaults`. They prove no state write
  leaked into a component. They say nothing about whether anything rendered.
- **`ListPicker` splices the array you give it.** `getValue` returns a `.slice()`.
- **Some tab contents read the live document while being constructed.** `detailed_results.tsx`
  does `document.querySelector('.dr-toolbar')` (and the same for the sticky-toolbar root) inside its
  constructor, so its pane must already be in the page by then. This is why `SimTabRegistry.attach`
  appends both elements itself instead of leaving placement to React — React only reasserts order
  afterwards. Any React-rendered pane in Phase 2+ hits this: fix the lookups before moving the pane
  into a component's render, or they silently find nothing.
- **Tooltips portal to `<body>`**, so they outlive their component's subtree. Unmount cleanup is
  load-bearing; assert it in the component's test.
- **`localization.tsx` walks the DOM** for `[data-i18n]` and writes `textContent`. React
  reconciliation clobbers that — React components need `useTranslation`.
- **`use` is a reserved prefix now.** `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` keys on it, so a non-hook helper
  named `useX` is a lint error. Name factories `makeUseX` (this is why
  `makeUseDotBaseValueCheckbox` reads the way it does — the proto field is `useDotBaseValue`).
- **`rules-of-hooks` is not in the react plugin's default category.** It is listed explicitly in
  `.oxlintrc.json`; if you rebuild that config, it silently stops running.

## Verification

Run `wowsims-ui`'s gate list, plus `npm run test:unit` (vitest + happy-dom, config in
`vitest.config.mts`).

Two things specific to this migration:

- **Goldens must stay byte-identical.** The port touches `view/` only, so any golden diff means a
  state write leaked into a component. Never regenerate to make it pass.
- **DOM parity is the real gate for the shell**, and it lives in `tools/react-migration/` — four
  Playwright checks against a build of this branch and one of the parent branch, served on two
  ports. `parity.mjs` (structure at load, ~4,000 elements per spec), `panes-parity.mjs` (each tab's contents
  once opened), `tabs-a11y.mjs` (attributes + keyboard), `tabs-behaviour.mjs` (clicking every tab),
  `mount-once.mjs` (StrictMode — against a dev server, see above). Read its README for the
  two expected class diffs and the environmental console errors. Use Playwright, not the Chrome
  extension — the extension reports false "renderer frozen" on this app.

## Change log (keep current — this skill documents itself)

- 2026-09-05 Phase 1 complete: React renders the shell, in two steps. **1a** added
  `<div id="root">`, renamed `spec_entry.ts` → `.tsx`, and moved construction into `SimApp` behind a
  `useRef` gate — the shell is still built by `IndividualSimUI`, React just owns when. **1b**
  inverted the tabs: `SimTab` and `SimUI.addTab` hand their elements to `SimTabRegistry` instead of
  appending into the header and calling `data-bs-toggle="tab"`, and `SimTabs` decides order, clicks
  and `active`/`show`. Bootstrap's tab plugin no longer drives the top-level tabs; the tab sets
  *inside* detailed-results, bulk, rotation and the selector modal are still Bootstrap's, by design.
  `SimTabs` also re-implements what the plugin did beyond clicking — roving `tabindex`, arrow and
  Home/End navigation with wrap-around and focus following the selection — and panes carry
  `role="tabpanel"` in their markup, which the plugin used to stamp on load. Two behaviour notes:
  `SimHeader.activateTab` now calls `registry.activate` instead of `.click()`ing the nav-link, so a
  programmatic tab switch no longer fires `trackPageView` (user clicks still do); and the pane open
  on load gets `show` in the same frame as `active`, because only a *switch* needs to fade.
  `SimHeader.activateTab` now delegates to the registry, so the bulk results renderer's
  "back to gear" path is unchanged. Two deliberate DOM diffs against the parent branch, both
  pre-existing quirks removed rather than introduced: the gear nav-*link* no longer carries `show`
  (a pane class Bootstrap put there), and the literal class `false` from
  `${isFirstTab && 'active'}` is gone. Gate: DOM parity across 5 specs (element counts identical,
  only those two class diffs), a Playwright click sweep of all 6 tabs on those specs, goldens
  byte-identical, and 39 unit tests. The four checks are committed at `tools/react-migration/`.

- 2026-09-04 Phase 0 complete. React 19.2 alongside tsx-vanilla: tsconfig and both vite configs
  moved to the automatic runtime, the 94 existing `.tsx` files gained
  `/** @jsxImportSource @jsx-vanilla */`, and the shim landed at `ui/shared/jsx-vanilla/`. Both
  unknowns were verified rather than assumed — TypeScript 7 honours the per-file pragma, and Vite
  8's oxc transform does too (confirmed by inspecting the emitted bundle: React absent,
  tsx-vanilla's `element` present). DOM parity held across 5 specs. Added vitest + happy-dom
  (`npm run test:unit`), `LegacyHost`, `useStoreSubscribe`, and the typed `Icon`. Turned on
  `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` (error) and `exhaustive-deps` (warn), which forced renaming two
  non-hook APL builders to `makeUse*`. Measured, resolving an open question: a `batch()` writing
  three slices produces exactly one React render with or without `subscribeGated`, so the gate is a
  vanilla-subscriber concern only.
